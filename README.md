# Vagrant Ansible Provisioning for Ubuntu 14.04

This repository provides a Vagrant setup with Ansible provisioning for creating a virtual machine running Ubuntu 14.04.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ashnike/Vagrant-3t.git
    ```

2. **Change to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Vagrant-3t
    ```

3. **Start the virtual machine:**

    ```bash
    vagrant up
    ```

4. **Destroying the Virtual Machine:**

    When you're done, you can destroy the virtual machine:

    ```bash
    vagrant destroy
    ```

    This will remove the virtual machine, but your project files will remain intact.
